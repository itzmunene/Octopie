### OCTOPIE - Machine Learning Anti-Virus Experiment

# 🧬 Digital Immune System: Pathogen-Inspired Cyber Defense Framework  

> From **cells to cyber** — building a smarter, more adaptive antivirus inspired by *you know… the actual human immune system.*

## 🧠 What’s This All About?

Traditional antivirus systems? They’re like bouncers who only recognise last week’s troublemakers.  
This project flips that idea — building a **bio-inspired defense system** that learns, adapts, and remembers threats, just like your body does when it fights viruses and bacteria.  

We’re borrowing ideas from immunology and machine learning to create an **adaptive, layered antimalware architecture** that doesn’t just react — it *evolves*.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Think of your computer as a body. Each layer of this digital immune system plays the role of a biological counterpart:

| 🧩 Biological Function | 💻 Cybersecurity Role | 🔬 Implementation Layer |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Sensory Receptors | Collect system telemetry | Layer 1: Signal Acquisition |
| Innate Immunity | Heuristic & NSA detection | Layer 2: Innate Detection |
| Adaptive Immunity | ML-based analysis | Layer 3: Adaptive Detection |
| Inflammatory Response | Quarantine & rollback | Layer 4: Response & Containment |
| Memory Cells | Reinforcement & federated learning | Layer 5: Memory & Learning |
